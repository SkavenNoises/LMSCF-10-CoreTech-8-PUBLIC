                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>
                    Hey there, I am 23 years old, I was born in Vienna, but went to High School in Florida, and did my Bachelors degree in business in London. Even though I loved studying in London, I am kind of glad to be back, and right now I am enjoying my life here. <br>
                </p>

                <hr>

                <h2>Why Coding?</h2>
                <p>
                    I always wanted to learn coding, and all of the start-up ideas, had one problem in common and that was that I did not know how to code at all, therefore I am learning now, and I am quite excited. 
                </p>

                <hr>

                <h2>So what do you do?</h2>
                <p>
                    Right now, I am learning how to be a full stack developer, but I will focus, more on the frontend part of websites, because design is everything, and then comes the rest.<br>
                    In the future I will learn Java, and I will definitely learn how to code Android apps.   
                </p>

                <hr>

                <h2>Looking to the future</h2>
                <p>
                    I want to move to a different country. The destination is not clear yet, but it will be a smaller city I assume. There I want to get a job as a frontend developer and want to gain experience in that field.  
                </p>

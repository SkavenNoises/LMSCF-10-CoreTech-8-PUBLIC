                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Hey, I'm Kieran. Hailing from Scotland, Edinburgh.<br>
                I got my education from Teesside University as a biochemical forensic analyst. Though never found many openings in that field so I quickly made a 180° to something in IT. Well, it is one way to burn £40k<br>
                Quickly getting involved in game testing voluntarily and then in the industry. It quickly became apparent that automation testing was needed, so that was my first dip into some python... then java... then the rabbit hole gets deeper...<br>
                </p>

                <hr>

                <h2>Why Coding?</h2>
                <p>It didn't take long for me to fall in love with the problem solving aspect of coding. From there my horizons just kept opening up and after a few years now the ever developing world of programming is an interesting challenge to meet</p>

                <hr>

                <h2>So what do you do?</h2>
                <p>At this point I have had my hand at a few different projects already, you can find the more interesting ones on my personal GitHub. But this includes Android applications for stage props, companion apps for certain pen'n'paper games, a bunch of "I'm too lazy" web automation for job search and account migrations.<br>
                for the longest time I have been around Java a lot so getting to work on more projects like that is something I plan to keep up!  
                </p>

                <hr>

                <h2>Looking to the future</h2>
                <p>After this course I have been put into a company called Expleo as a consultant. So theres going to be much travel in my future and getting to be a part of different projects. With many different types of problems to find solutions to. After so long of being unsure of what to do with myself in the professional field it will be nice to settle into a company and get to putting a skill I enjoy into practice</p>
